As Term 2 came to a close, I was indifferent. I had already been cooped up at home for an entire month — was there anything to look forward to? When the holidays kicked in, my predictions were, for the most part, right. I could not go out, there was nothing but work to do at home, and my hair was growing to start covering my eyes. Singapore’s sweltering weather did not help either.

However, the break did in fact have some ups to it. I managed to get some rest, and even found time to pursue some of my hobbies and interests. I admittedly did not manage to revise schoolwork as much as I wanted to; the Chinese idiom 力不从心 comes to mind. Perhaps it was because my mind simply wanted to find respite after a stressful term.

Now that I am back in school, I feel happier. Sure, I did manage to get out of the house once to meet up with my primary school friends. But going out just once proved to be insufficient to quench my thirst for getting outdoors. Nevertheless, I am glad that schools are now open. HBL this year was a first, but it would be foolish for us to not consider the fact that HBL might spring up out of the blue. We should continue to persist in learning, whether remote or physical, amidst the volatile, uncertain COVID-19 landscape.

I hope that you also had a meaningful June Holiday!
